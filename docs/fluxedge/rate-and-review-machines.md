# Rate and Review Machines

### Leaving a Rating and Review

After you end a machine rental, you'll be prompted to rate your experience. This includes:

* **Star Rating (1-5 stars)**: Choose a star rating that best reflects your experience.
* **Review Title**: Provide a brief title for your review.
* **Review Message**: Share your thoughts about the machine—what you liked or disliked. The message has a 500-character limit.
* **Category (Optional)**: Select a review category that best fits your feedback, if applicable.

The review process is optional and can be skipped when the rental is completed. You can also leave a review for past rentals anytime through the **Audit** section in your **Account Settings**.

### Review Submission

Once you submit your review:

* The review and star rating will be visible to other users.
* The machine owner will receive an email notification (if enabled) to inform them of the review and any feedback shared.

### Accessing Machine Reviews

To view reviews for a specific machine, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Machine Rental List**, or **Audit** to access past rentals.
2. Click on the blue **Machine ID** of the machine you're interested in.
3. You'll land on the **System** tab, where you can view hardware and software specs. Next to it, there's a **Review** tab—click it to see all ratings and reviews for the machine.

### Machine Rating and Reviews

In the **Review** tab, you’ll find:

* **Machine Rating**: An average star rating (rounded to one decimal) based on all reviews.
* **Rating Distribution**: A bar chart showing how many ratings were given for each star level (1-5 stars).
* **Customer Reviews**: A list of reviews for the machine, showing:
  * Reviewer's username
  * Date and time of the review
  * Review title and message
  * Star rating and category (if selected)

You can **upvote** or **downvote** reviews to indicate whether you found them helpful. Additionally, you have the option to **report** reviews if you believe there is an issue. Reports are reviewed by the FluxEdge team, and we may take appropriate action, including removing reviews, if the report is deemed valid.
