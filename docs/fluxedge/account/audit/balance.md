# Balance

The Audit Balance tab provides comprehensive balance information for your FluxEdge account.

You will see a data table with detailed information about all balance changes, including deposits, spending, and other transactions.

* **Date:** The date and time of the balance action.
* **Description:** A description of the action performed.
* **Payment:** The method used for the action, such as a credit card or PayPal for deposits, or credit balance for payments.
* **Amount:** The USD value by which your FluxEdge balance was affected.
* **Total Price:** The actual USD value credited to your account. This may differ from the Amount column due to transaction fees, bonuses, etc. For example, if you deposit funds using Stripe or PayPal, the Amount column shows the increase in your balance, while the Total Price reflects the total paid, including fees.

You can filter the information by payment types, as well as by time frames such as day, week, month, or year. Additionally, you will see information about when this account was created.
