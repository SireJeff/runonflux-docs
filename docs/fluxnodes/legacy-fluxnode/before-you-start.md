# Before You Start

Running a FluxNode is a rewarding way to contribute to the Flux network, but it’s important to begin with the right preparation. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know and do—step by step.

***

### Stay Safe - Avoid Scams

Always seek help through **official Flux channels**, such as this Gitbook and the [Flux Helpdesk](https://support.runonflux.io/support/home).\
While community support is available in the [Flux Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/runonflux), please note that **unofficial assistance is at your own risk**.

***

### Technical Requirements

Setting up and maintaining a FluxNode requires some basic technical know-how. You **do not need prior Linux experience**—this guide covers each step in detail to help you succeed.

Ensure your hardware and internet meet the required specifications for your desired node tier (Cumulus, Nimbus, or Stratus).\

### Hosting From Home

If you plan to host your FluxNode at home:

* ✅ You’ll need a **high-quality router** with **UPnP support**
* 📶 Your internet must meet the **minimum upload and download bandwidth** for your chosen tier
* ⚠️ Routers provided by ISPs can sometimes cause issues—**community-tested router recommendations are available here**

### Renting A Server

Prefer not to host at home? No problem.

A list of **community-recommended hosting providers** for each FluxNode tier is available:\

***

### Try Before You Commit - Use TestNet

Not sure if your hardware is ready? Want to try the process before investing real resources?\
You can test the entire setup using **Flux TestNet**.

Detailed TestNet instructions are available in the `#testnet-instructions` channel of the Flux Discord

### Alternatives To Running A FluxNode Yourself

If you decide that managing your own node isn’t right for you, there are still ways to participate:

* Use a [**managed node service**](../managed-fluxnode-service.md) to run your node while retaining full control of your funds
* Stake your Flux on a [**Titan Node**](../titan-node-staking.md) with just a ZelCore wallet and some Flux
* Use **staking services via Binance or CoinMetro**, which offer convenient options for earning rewards
