# Legacy FluxNode

Legacy FluxNodes are the original deployment method for participating in the Flux network. They run on standard Linux distributions and require the operator to manually install, configure, and maintain FluxOS. While they remain fully functional for earning native block and parallel mining rewards, they do not receive FluxCloud application revenue unless upgraded to ArcaneOS.

### What is a Legacy FluxNode

A Legacy FluxNode is any FluxNode deployed on a supported Linux OS using the traditional FluxOS installation process. Operators are responsible for:

* Installing the operating system and FluxOS manually
* Applying security patches and software updates
* Monitoring uptime
* Troubleshooting hardware, OS, or FluxOS issues as they arise

Because setup and maintenance are manual, Legacy nodes require more technical knowledge and time commitment than newer automated solutions like ArcaneOS.

### Key Characteristics

* **Full Control** – Operators have complete administrative access to the server, allowing for custom configurations and flexibility.
* **Manual Maintenance** – All updates (OS, FluxOS, dependencies) must be performed by the operator, which can increase downtime risk.
* **Reward Eligibility** – Eligible for **native FLUX block rewards** and **parallel mining rewards**, but **not** for Progressive Node Rewards (PNR) tied to FluxCloud application revenue.
* **Hardware & Collateral Requirements** – Must meet the specs for their chosen tier (Cumulus, Nimbus, Stratus) and lock the corresponding FLUX collateral.

### Why Legacy Nodes Still Matter

Legacy FluxNodes remain a viable way to earn FLUX rewards and contribute to network decentralization. They are well-suited for operators who:

* Prefer full system control and customization
* Already have compatible hardware and Linux expertise
* Are primarily interested in block and parallel mining rewards rather than FluxCloud application revenue

### Looking Ahead

While Legacy nodes continue to function and earn rewards, the Flux roadmap prioritizes ArcaneOS for new features, enhanced security, and enterprise compliance. Operators seeking maximum earnings potential and lower maintenance overhead are encouraged to migrate to ArcaneOS when ready.
