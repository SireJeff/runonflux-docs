# Step 4: Start Your FluxNode

Congratulations! You’ve successfully installed and configured your FluxNode.\
The final step is to **start your node** so it can begin operating on the Flux network.

Starting your FluxNode will:

* Activate your node on the blockchain.
* Begin blockchain and FluxOS services.
* Allow the network to recognize and verify your node’s collateral transaction.

***

### Choose Your Wallet Setup

The exact process for starting your node depends on which wallet you are using to manage your FluxNode. Please select the guide that matches your setup:

* [**Start via Zelcore**](start-via-zelcore.md) – For users running their FluxNode with **Zelcore**.
* [**Start via SSP**](start-via-ssp.md) – For users running their FluxNode with the **SSP Wallet**.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Make sure you follow the **correct guide** for your wallet. Using the wrong instructions can prevent your node from starting correctly or cause it to be rejected by the network.
