# Step 1: Prepare Flux Collateral

To run a FluxNode, you’ll need to lock a specific amount of **Flux coins** as collateral. This locked collateral validates your FluxNode on the network—but rest assured, **you retain full control of your funds at all times**.

> ⚠️ Your Flux is never sent to a smart contract or third party—it remains in your own wallet, simply marked as "locked" by the network while your FluxNode is active.

Unlocking your collateral (for example, if you wish to stop running the FluxNode) takes less than a minute and can be done at any time.

### Collateral Amounts by FluxNode Tier

| Node Tier   | Required Collateral |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| **Cumulus** | 1,000 Flux          |
| **Nimbus**  | 12,500 Flux         |
| **Stratus** | 40,000 Flux         |

### What You'll Do in This Step

In the following pages, you'll:

1. **Create a new Flux wallet** (if you don’t already have one)
2. **Send the required amount of Flux** to your wallet
3. **Lock the collateral** by sending it to yourself in a single transaction
