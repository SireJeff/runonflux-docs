# Install Docker (Option 1)

Docker is the container platform that runs FluxNode. In this step, you’ll install Docker, create a secure non‑root user, and prepare your server for the FluxNode installation.

***

### Detailed Step-by-Step Configuration

1. At the **Toolbox menu**, press **`1`** to install Docker.
2. When prompted, enter a **non‑root username** for Docker access.

* **💡 Tip:** Choose a username you’ll easily remember — you will need it for all future logins to your server.
