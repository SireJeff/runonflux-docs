# Create Installation Configuration (Option 6)

In this step, we’ll create the **FluxNode Installation Configuration File**.\
This file contains all the key details your node needs — such as your FluxNode identity, collateral transaction information, and other configuration settings.

***

### Choose Your Wallet Setup

The exact process will differ depending on **which wallet you are using** to manage your FluxNode.\
Please select the guide that matches your setup:

* [**Zelcore Configuration**](zelcore-configuration.md) – For users running their FluxNode with **Zelcore Wallet**.
* [**SSP Wallet Configuration**](ssp-wallet-configuration.md) – For users running their FluxNode with the **SSP Wallet**&#x20;

> ⚠️ **Important:** Make sure you follow the correct guide for your wallet. Using the wrong instructions will result in incorrect configuration and setup errors.
