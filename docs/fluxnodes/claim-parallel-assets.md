# Claim Parallel Assets

When operating a FluxNode, you don’t just earn native **FLUX** — you also accumulate **Parallel Assets**.\
These are rewards distributed on other blockchains (such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Kadena, Solana, etc.) through Flux’s **Parallel Mining** program.

***

### Overview

* **Additional Earnings** – For each active parallel asset, you receive **10% of your FluxNode reward** (≈ 3.75 FLUX worth) in that asset.
* **Potential to Double Rewards** – When all 10 parallel assets are active, this adds up to ≈ **37.5 FLUX worth** in parallel assets on top of your normal FLUX earnings.
* **Manual Claim Required** – Parallel Assets are **not** automatically sent to your wallet; you must claim them using the **Fusion** app in Zelcore.
* **Claiming Fees** – Each claim has a network fee. To reduce fees, it’s best to claim occasionally instead of after every reward. Claiming is only possible if your accumulated amount is greater than the fee.
* **Fee Adjustments** – Claim fees are subject to change and are periodically reviewed by the Flux Team.
