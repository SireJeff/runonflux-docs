# 9. Accessing the System

Once your FluxNode is operational, there are two primary ways to access its command interfaces: the built‑in Shell Console (via the web UI) and SSH (if you enabled it during setup). You can also reconfigure your FluxNode settings at any time.

***

### Shell Console

Use the Shell Console for limited, in‑browser access to your node:

1. **Open the Shell**
   * Click the **Shell** button in the top‑left corner of the Metrics Dashboard.

2. **Authenticate**

| Credential   | Value                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Username** | `console`                       |
| **Password** | The password you set at install |

3. **Available Commands**\
   After login, you’ll see a list of permitted commands (e.g., `fluxd status`, `syncthing status`, `reconfigure`). These cover all routine maintenance tasks without exposing full root access.

### SSH Access (Optional)

If you enabled SSH during configuration, you can connect externally using your `operator` account:

| Credential      | Value                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Username**    | `operator`                            |
| **Auth Method** | **Private key** (`operator_key` file) |

```bash
ssh -i operator_key operator@<node-ip>
```

> 🔐 SSH access uses the limited‑privilege `operator` user to ensure secure maintenance.

***

### Reconfigure Your FluxNode

Want to update notification settings, SSH keys, or blocklists? Reconfigure on the fly:

1. Click the **Settings** (gear) icon in the web UI.
2. Select **Reconfigure FluxNode**.
   * Flux services will pause (except daemon syncing) while you adjust settings.
3. Apply changes and allow services to resume.

> ⚠️ Reconfiguration is safe but will interrupt most FluxOS services temporarily.
