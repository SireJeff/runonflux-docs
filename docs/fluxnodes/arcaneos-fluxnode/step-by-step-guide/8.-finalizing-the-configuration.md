# 8. Finalizing the Configuration

After applying your settings, return to the VM console to confirm that Arcane OS has transitioned into its operational phase.

### Metrics Dashboard

On boot, the **Metrics Dashboard** provides real‑time insights into your node’s health:

| Metric                | Description                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Node Uptime**       | Total time since last reboot                                       |
| **Service Health**    | Status indicators for core services (fluxd, fluxbenchd, syncthing) |
| **Daemon Sync State** | Progress of blockchain synchronization                             |

> ℹ️ When running multiple nodes on a private LAN, Arcane OS will attempt to peer‑sync from any fully synced local node (within maintenance windows), reducing reliance on CDN bootstrap.

> **Note:** Future releases will expand this dashboard with additional metrics and diagnostics.

### Chain Downloading

Although your configuration is complete, the Flux blockchain must still download and validate:

1. **Background Services**
   * **syncthing** and **fluxbenchd** will start automatically.
   * **fluxd** may restart several times as it catches up.
2. **Offline State**
   * FluxOS remains “offline” in the dashboard until **fluxd** is fully synced.
3. **Completion Indicator**
   * When synchronization finishes, a **“Shell”** button appears in the top‑left corner of the dashboard.

> ⏳ This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to over an hour, depending on hardware performance and network bandwidth.

### Starting Your FluxNode

With the blockchain synced and services running:

1. **Activate Your FluxNode**
   * In your **ZelCore** or **SSP Wallet**, navigate to **FluxNode** and click **Start**.
2. **Verify Operation**
   * Confirm your node’s status changes to **“Running”** in the wallet and dashboard.

🎉 **Congratulations!** Your FluxNode is now fully operational on Arcane OS, securing the network and earning rewards.
