# Unlocking FluxNode Collateral

If you wish to remove your FluxNode and unlock your collateral in Zelcore, the process is simple and only takes a few minutes. This guide will walk you through it step‑by‑step.

⚠ **Important:**

* Avoid refreshing or revisiting the FluxNodes screen during the unlock process — this will cause your funds to lock again and require you to repeat the procedure.
* Unlocking your collateral does **not** affect the hardware running your node — you can safely turn it off at any time.

### Step‑by‑Step: How to Unlock your FluxNode Collateral

#### 1. Open FluxNodes in Zelcore

* Launch **Zelcore** and go to **Apps → FluxNodes**.
* Locate the FluxNode(s) you want to remove.

#### 2. Delete the Node Entry

* Select the node(s) you wish to remove.
* Click the **Delete** button.
* **Do not** refresh or leave this screen until the process is complete.

#### 3. Wait for the Unlock Process

* The collateral unlock happens quickly, usually within seconds.
* Once done, click the **Back** button to return to your wallet.

#### 4. Verify Your Funds

* Navigate to the wallet that contains your collateral.
* Your Flux should now be **unlocked** and available for transfer.

#### 5. Optional — Prevent Funds from Relocking

* If you plan to keep your unlocked Flux in the same wallet, send a small transaction to break the exact collateral amount and prevent accidental relocking.
* Send **any amount that is not equal to your node’s collateral**:
  * Example for a Cumulus node: send **999.99 FLUX** or **1000.01 FLUX**.
