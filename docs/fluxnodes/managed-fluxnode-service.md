# Managed FluxNode Service

If running your own FluxNode isn't for you, consider using a **managed FluxNode service**. These providers set up, host, and maintain your FluxNode on your behalf, while you retain full control of your FLUX collateral and can withdraw it at any time.

> ⚠️ Using a managed FluxNode service is a great alternative if you're less technical or prefer not to self-host. It offers convenience and peace of mind—but it isn’t risk-free. Do your homework, choose wisely, and always keep control of your collateral.

### Legal Disclaimer & Due Dilligence

### How It Works

* The provider hosts your node on VPS or dedicated hardware in reliable data centers.
* You receive **node earnings directly** into your non-custodial wallet—**you always keep custody of your FLUX**.
* Providers typically offer **automatic updates**, 24/7 monitoring, benchmark assurance, and uptime guarantees.

| ✔️ No technical setup or maintenance required                | ⚠️ Monthly fees can outweigh node rewards (especially for low-tier nodes)                              |
| ✔️ Reliable uptime with managed infrastructure               | ⚠️ Trust risk: your provider controls uptime and configuration                                         |
| ✔️ Auto updates, benchmark monitoring, support included      | ⚠️ Limited configurability compared to self-hosting                                                    |
| ✔️ Scalable across node tiers—upgrade easily                 | ⚠️ Risk of centralization if many users rely on the same provider                                      |
| ✔️ Non-custodial: you retain control of your FLUX collateral | ⚠️ Poor support or mismanagement can affect uptime or earnings (reported delays in refunds or service) |
