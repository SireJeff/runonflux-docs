# HOME

HOME is the **developer-oriented dashboard** for FluxCloud. It provides full access to the latest features and specifications of the FluxCloud backend and is updated in sync with platform development. It’s ideal for technical users, infrastructure providers, and anyone who wants fine-grained control over deployments.

HOME does not currently support **WordPress** or **FluxDrive**, but those are planned for future releases.
