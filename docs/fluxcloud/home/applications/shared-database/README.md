# Shared Database

Flux Shared DB is a decentralized, persistent database service built on FluxCloud. It bundles standard DB engines with a custom “operator” that:

1. Discovers peers via FluxCloud
2. Forms a Master‑Slave cluster
3. Exposes a native DB interface on port **3307**

### Overview

* **High‑Availability Cluster**\
  Replicates automatically across ≥3 FluxNodes. No single point of failure.
* **Master‑Slave Replication**
  * **Master** handles writes, stamps and sequences them.
  * **Slaves** replicate the Master’s data.
  * **Reads** served locally by any node.
* **Scalability & Fault Tolerance**
  * Reads scale horizontally with added nodes.
  * Writes remain globally ordered by the Master.
