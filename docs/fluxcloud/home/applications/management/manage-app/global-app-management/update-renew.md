# Update/Renew

The **Update/Renew** tab allows you to update your deployed application, including compute resources, geolocation preferences, environment parameters, and subscription settings.

#### How To Access

> **Applications → Management → Manage App → Global App Management → Update/Renew**

Open the **Management** tab in the **Applications** menu, select an application from **My Active Apps**, click **Manage**, then go to the **Global App Management** section and open the **Update/Renew** tab.

***

### Overview

Use this tab to either:

* **Extend your subscription**, and/or
* **Update your application specifications**

At the top of the page, you’ll see two toggles:

* **Update Specifications**: Enable this if you want to change any application or component configuration.
* **Extend Subscription**: Enable this to add more time to your current subscription period.

### Update Specifications

This section allows you to modify the configuration of your app or its components, as originally defined during initial deployment.

> ⚠️ You **cannot** add new components during an update.\
> ✅ You **can** change the **owner** field to transfer app ownership.

Refer to the [Register New App](broken-reference) page for details on each configuration field.

Once you’ve made the necessary changes, decide whether you also want to extend the subscription period using the toggle.

***

### Extend Subscription

Toggle this **ON** to add more time to your app's existing subscription.\
Toggle it **OFF** to keep the current expiration date unchanged.

* **By default**, this toggle is **on**, meaning your new subscription duration will be added on top of the current expiry.
* Turning it **off** means your app will continue running until its original expiration date, without any added time.

#### Example

You deployed your app with a **30-day** subscription and choose to update it after **10 days**:

* With **subscription toggle off**, your app will continue for the remaining **20 days**.
* With **subscription toggle on** and **30 days** selected, the app will run for an additional **30 days**, totaling **50 days**.
