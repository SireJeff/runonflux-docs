### Overview

#### Primary/Standby App Information (Optional)

If your app is configured with **Primary/Standby** container data, the current **Primary node** will be displayed here along with its **IP address**. Use this IP to connect directly to the primary instance.

#### World Map View

A dynamic, interactive world map displays the geographic distribution of your app's running nodes. You can zoom in and out to pinpoint the exact location of each active FluxNode.

#### Data Table Overview

Alongside the map, a data table lists detailed information for each instance, including:

* **IP Address**
* **Continent**
* **Country**
* **Region**

Additionally, two actionable buttons are provided:

* **App** – Opens a direct link to the deployed app’s web interface (if available).
* **FluxNode** – Launches the FluxOS interface for the specific node, allowing for in-depth inspection or monitoring.
