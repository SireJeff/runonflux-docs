# Backup & Restore

The **Backup & Restore** tab allows you to create, download, and restore backups of your running application on the Flux Cloud. This ensures you can securely save your application state and recover it in the event of deletion, failure, or redeployment.

#### How To Access

> **Applications → Management → Manage App → Local App Management → Backup & Restore**

Open the **Management** tab in the **Applications** menu, select an application from **My Active Apps**, click **Manage**, then go to the **Local App Management** section and open the **Backup & Restore** tab.

#### Backend Selector

At the top right you'll find a **FluxNode IP selector**, letting you choose which node you want to inspect or control. This allows you to manage individual node instances of your app. A **reload button** is also available to refresh the list of currently active FluxNodes running your application.
