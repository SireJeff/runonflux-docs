# Information

The **Information** tab provides an in-depth, technical snapshot of your app’s container, pulling metadata directly from the Docker engine. This view is ideal for debugging, verifying configuration, and ensuring operational integrity. Use this tab when validating your app’s runtime configuration or performing diagnostics.

#### How To Access

> **Applications → Management → Manage App → Local App Management → Information**

Open the **Management** tab in the **Applications** menu, select an application from **My Active Apps**, click **Manage**, then go to the **Local App Management** section and open the **Information** tab.

#### Backend Selector

At the top right you'll find a **FluxNode IP selector**, letting you choose which node you want to inspect or control. This allows you to manage individual node instances of your app. A **reload button** is also available to refresh the list of currently active FluxNodes running your application.
