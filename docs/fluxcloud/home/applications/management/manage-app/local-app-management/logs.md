# Logs

The **Logs** tab provides direct access to the recent logs generated by your application. It’s a key tool for diagnosing issues, monitoring behavior, and confirming successful execution.

#### How To Access

> **Applications → Management → Manage App → Local App Management → Logs**

Open the **Management** tab in the **Applications** menu, select an application from **My Active Apps**, click **Manage**, then go to the **Local App Management** section and open the **Logs** tab.

#### Backend Selector

At the top right you'll find a **FluxNode IP selector**, letting you choose which node you want to inspect or control. This allows you to manage individual node instances of your app. A **reload button** is also available to refresh the list of currently active FluxNodes running your application.
