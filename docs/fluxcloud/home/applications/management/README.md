# Management

The **Management** tab allows you to view and manage all of your deployed applications on FluxCloud.\
From here, you can quickly access the status, details, and expiration information of each application. It serves as your central dashboard for managing everything you've deployed.

***

### Overview of Tabs

At the top of the **Management** page, you'll find navigation tabs that help you filter your applications by current status:

* **My Active Apps** – Displays all applications that are currently running and valid.
* **My Expired Apps** – Displays applications that have reached the end of their subscription period. These can be quickly redeployed.

You can also:

* Use the search bar to find specific applications.
* Select how many entries to view per page.

### My Active Apps

The **My Active Apps** tab provides a focused view of all applications you currently have running on FluxCloud. This dashboard is ideal for monitoring live deployments, making real-time changes, and accessing detailed management controls.
