### Finding our your IP of the Game Server

Flux runs on a decentralized network, meaning your application is deployed across **three instances**.\
For game servers, a **Primary/Standby** setup is used — your game runs on the primary instance, while others are on standby for redundancy.

To find your server’s **primary IP address**:

1. Visit [**cloud.runonflux.com**](https://cloud.runonflux.com) and log in.
2. Go to **Applications → Management**.
3. Click the **Settings icon** on your Enshrouded Server.
4. Open the **Instances** tab.
   * The **Primary IP address** is shown here.
   * You can also view geolocation details for all instances.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### How can I update my game server to the latest version?

Your Palworld server automatically checks for updates during startup and at regular intervals. If you’d like to update immediately, you can do so from your application’s management panel.

Simply open the **Applications → Management** section on FluxCloud, select your Palworld server, and go to the **Control** tab. From there, choose **Global** and click **Restart Application**. This will redeploy your server with the latest available version.

***

#### What happens if the primary server goes down?

If your current primary server becomes unavailable or experiences downtime, one of the standby instances automatically takes over as the new primary after a short delay. All your game data remains intact, so you can continue right where you left off once the switch is complete. You can check which instance is currently the primary from your application’s management panel under the _Instances_ tab.

***

#### Can I change the game server settings and/or setup a password to connect to my game server?

Yes, you can customize your Enshrouded server settings just like on a standard VPS. Please note that **basic terminal and Linux proficiency** is required for this process.

Go to **Applications → Management**, select the **settings icon** to manage your **Palworld** server, and open the **Secure Shell** tab. Select the **Enshrouded** component, choose **bin/bash**, and click **Connect**.

<img src="/.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-11-03 145446.jpg" alt=""/>

Once connected:

* Update your package lists with:

```bash
apt update
```

* Install the Nano text editor (only required once after purchase):

```bash
apt install nano
```

* Navigate to the game server directory:

```bash
cd /opt/enshrouded/server/
```

* Open the configuration file for editing:

```bash
nano enshrouded_server.json
```

You can now modify settings such as the **server name**, **player limit**, or **password** directly in this file.\
When finished, save your changes with **Ctrl + S**, then exit Nano using **Ctrl + X**.

After editing, open the **Control** tab in your management panel, select **Global**, and click **Restart Application** to apply your new settings.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Be cautious when modifying configuration values — incorrect changes may prevent your game server from functioning properly.

***

#### What if a new version of the game server is released and my server doesn't update automatically?

Your server normally updates itself automatically during startup or periodic checks. However, if it hasn’t updated yet, a simple restart from the management panel will trigger the update and ensure you’re running the latest version.
