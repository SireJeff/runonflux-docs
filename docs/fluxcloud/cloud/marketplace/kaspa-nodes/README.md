# Kaspa Nodes

This guide walks you through the process of **deploying, managing, and connecting to a Kaspa Node** **(Mainnet or Testnet)** using FluxCloud. Whether you’re setting up a new node or maintaining an existing one, this page provides step-by-step instructions and key details for a seamless experience.

### How To Install a Kaspa Node

#### **Overview**

Deploying a Kaspa Node on FluxCloud allows you to participate in the Kaspa network with full redundancy, automated failover, and blockchain-backed registration — all managed from an easy-to-use web interface.

#### **Steps**

1. **Access FluxCloud**
   * Visit [cloud.runonflux.com](https://cloud.runonflux.com) and sign in or create an account.

4. **Specify Your Deployment Location [Optional]**

* Specify if you want to only allow certain geolocations to spawn your kapsa node or forbidd certain geolocations.
* By default your Kaspa node will be deployed on random servers globally 
* Supported are continent, and additionally Country selection
* Save your selection by clicking the **+ Add Allowed/Forbidden** button.

5. **Email Notications [Optional]**

* Enter your email address to receive notifications about your game server, including:
  * When your application finishes launching.
  * When the primary server changes.
  * When your app expiration date is approaching.

6. **Launching the Application**

* Your application must be signed and registered on the Flux network.
  * Click the **Sign and Register** button.
  * Sign the message using the pop-up.
    * If you logged in via Google or Email, this step is completed automatically.

7. **Complete Payment**

* Choose your payment method:
  * **Fiat:** Stripe or PayPal
  * **Crypto:** FLUX coin (5% discount)
* Payment is monitored automatically. Once confirmed, your application will be deployed, and a blue Manage button will appear—directing you to your application’s management panel.

> ⚠️ **Important: FLUX Payments**
>
> FLUX payments are **only accepted via the FLUX Mainnet,** not through any of our EVM tokens.
>
> We **ALSO** strongly recommend **not sending FLUX payments from exchanges**, as:
>
> * Transactions or withdrawals may not complete within the required 30-minute window.
> * Many exchanges do not support adding a **MEMO**, which is required for proper payment processing.
>
> To ensure a smooth transaction, use a compatible multi-chain wallet such as:
>
> * [**Zelcore**](https://zelcore.io/) — supports the Kaspa ecosystem (Mainnet, Kasplex, Igra Labs)
> * [**SSP Wallet**](https://sspwallet.io/) — multi-sig wallet for direct FLUX Mainnet payments

> With built-in auto-failover, FluxCloud is **redundant by design**. Each Kaspa Node deployment spins up **three independent nodes** that automatically fail over if needed, ensuring uptime and stronger decentralization — all for just **$27 a month**.

### How to Manage Your Kaspa Node

Once deployed, FluxCloud provides all the tools you need to monitor, update, and control your Kaspa Node instances directly from the management dashboard.

#### Access Your Kaspa Node Logs

**How to Access**

Applications → Management → Manage App → Logs

* Open the **Management** tab under **Applications**.
* Select your KaspaNode from **My Active Apps** and click **Manage**.
* Open the **Logs** tab.

**Backend Selector**

At the top right, you’ll find a **FluxNode IP selector**, allowing you to choose which node instance you want to inspect or control.\
Use the **reload button** to refresh the list of currently active FluxNodes running your app.

**Why This Is Useful**

* Troubleshoot issues or monitor node performance.
* Review startup or sync status messages.
* Confirm your node is running and connected properly.

**Successful Kaspa Node Synced 100%**

* If your Kaspa node is 100% synced you should see logs similar to the example below.

#### Connect to Your Kaspa Node

You can connect to your Kaspa Node directly via its public IP and designated ports for peer-to-peer, gRPC, or WRPC access.

**How to Find Node IPs:**

Applications → Management → Manage App → Running Instances

* Open the **Management** tab under **Applications**.
* Select your KaspaNode app and click **Manage**.
* Go to the **Running Instances** tab to view your node IPs.

**Port Usage:**

| Port  | Function   |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 15111 | P2P        |
| 15110 | gRPC       |
| 17110 | WRPC-Borsh |
| 18110 | WRPC-JSON  |

_For testnet connections, replace the middle digit with “2” (e.g., 15211 for P2P)._

**Example P2P connection:**

```
78.46.37.110:15111
```

**Test your Connection:**

You can use the website [https://nodes.kaspa.ws/](https://nodes.kaspa.ws/) to verify whether your Kaspa Node is publicly reachable via its P2P port.

1. Open [nodes.kaspa.ws](https://nodes.kaspa.ws/).
2. Enter one of your **FluxNode IP addresses** and the **P2P port (15111)** in the input fields.
3. Click the **Lookup** button to test connectivity.
4.  If your node is reachable, you’ll see a confirmation message such as:\


    > **Success! 65.109.52.141:15111 is a Crescendo compatible public node**

> **Note:** It may take up to a couple of hours after deployment for your node to become publicly reachable.
