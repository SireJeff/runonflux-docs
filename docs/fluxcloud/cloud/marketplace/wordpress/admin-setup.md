# Admin Setup

Before continuing with your WordPress setup, if you specified a custom domain, make sure to add a **CNAME record** pointing to the automatic domain generated by FluxCloud.\

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. Open your WordPress application domain in a browser:
   * This can be the **custom domain** you entered in the _WordPress Details_ tab.
   * Or, if no custom domain was specified, use the **default Flux-generated domain** (e.g., `https://wordpress123456789.app.runonflux.io`) by clicking the **App Details** button on your WordPress application under **My Apps > Active Apps**.
2. Once you see the WordPress welcome page (as shown in the example image), deployment is complete and you can proceed with the setup.
   * It typically takes **10 to 30 minutes** for all instances to finish deploying the application.
3. Select your preferred **language** and click **Continue**.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### I see a page saying "Error establishing a database connection." What should I do?

This usually means the required number of instances have not finished spawning yet.\
Please wait 10–30 minutes for the full deployment to complete.

If the error persists for more than an hour, it may indicate that one or more FluxNodes failed to deploy properly. In that case:

1. Go to **My Apps > Active Apps**, and click the **App Details** button on your WordPress application.
2. Check the list of deployed nodes (IP addresses). If any node is **not showing a SYNCED status**:
   * Click **Manage App**.
   * Under the **Local App Management** sectio&#x6E;**,** go to the **Control** tab
   * Select the problematic IP address in the **Backend Selector** and click **Remove App** to remove the app from that node.
3. If no specific node stands out, or if multiple nodes are misbehaving:
   * Under the **Global App Management** section, go to the **Control** tab, and click **Remove App** to trigger a redeploy across entirely new nodes.

#### I see an already installed WordPress website instead of the setup screen.

This means someone has already completed the setup process on this deployment.\
Here’s what you can do:

**Option A — Recommended:**\
Trigger a **hard redeploy** on all instances. This will clear the database and let you start fresh.

**Option B — Advanced:**\
Manually connect to the **WordPress database**, delete all the existing tables, and then revisit the setup URL to reinstall WordPress.

### Extra Notes

* After installing a **theme** or **plugin**, wait a few minutes before activating it. This allows time for the files to replicate across all nodes.
* When you **upload media files** (images, videos, etc.), it may take a few minutes for them to sync and appear consistently on all instances.dmin
