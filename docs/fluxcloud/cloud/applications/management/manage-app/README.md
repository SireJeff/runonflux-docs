# Manage App

The **Manage App** section is your control panel for operating and maintaining your application on the Flux Cloud. It offers both granular and global control over your app’s deployment, behavior, and resources.

This is where developers, sysadmins, and DevOps teams go to keep their apps performant, secure, and under control.

#### How To Access

> **Management → My Active Apps → Manage**

Open the **Management** tab in the **Applications** menu, select an application from **My Active Apps**, and click **Manage**.
