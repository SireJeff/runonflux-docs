# Geolocation

The **Geolocation** tab lets you control where your application will be deployed within the global network.

***

### Overview

By default, no geolocation restrictions are applied, and your app will be deployed randomly across the global network.

Use this tab to define **Allowed** or **Forbidden** locations based on continents, countries, or regions.
