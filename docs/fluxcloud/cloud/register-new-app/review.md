# Review

The **Review** tab is the final step before deploying your application to the Flux network. Once all previous tabs are completed, this page allows you to review and validate all application details.

### Review Your Application

After completing your application specifications, click the green **Review** button to open the **Review and Validate** screen.\
Here, you’ll complete all registration steps required before deployment.

   Your application specifications will be checked for any errors or inconsistencies.\
   If issues are found, you’ll be prompted to correct them before running the review again.\
