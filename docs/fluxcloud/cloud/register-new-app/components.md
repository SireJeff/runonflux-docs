# Components

The **Components** tab is where you define the technical details for each container that makes up your application.&#x20;

***

### Overview

In this tab, you define and manage each container (component) that makes up your application.

* Click the **"+" icon** to add a new component
* Use the "**red x" icon** to delete or reset an existing component
* Each component is configured independently with its own image, ports, resources, and settings

### Name

* Must be at least **3 characters** long
* Allowed characters: **A–Z, a–z, 0–9**
* **No spaces or special characters** allowed

### Description

* Must be at least **10 characters** long

### Repository Tag

Enter the **Docker container repository**

* Supported formats include: `namespace/repository:tag`
* Compatible with Docker Hub, GCR, GitHub Packages, and similar registries

### Repository Authentication

You need to enable "Enterprise" at the General Tab to use this feature

* Add your Docker authentication username:apikey

### Docker Path Builder

Define one or multiple shared data volumes for your container using the format:

```
/path
```

**Data Path Mode**

* **`r:`** (Replicated After Readiness)\
  Use `r:` to delay data synchronization until **all container instances are fully running**. This ensures volumes are only mounted and synced when all backends are confirmed live—ideal for consistency in replicated setups.
* **`g:`** (Primary/Standby)\
  Use `g:` to enable a **primary/standby configuration**. One instance acts as the primary (read–write), while the others stay in standby mode and only replicate changes from the primary.
* **No Prefix**\
  If no prefix (`r:` or `g:`) is used, the path is treated as a **standard local volume**. These are **non-persistent** and **not synchronized** between instances.

### Environment Variables (Optional)

Define environment variables for your container using the syntax:\
`VARIABLE=value`

* Click the "Environment Variables" button
* Enter a Key, and Value, then click the **"+ icon"** to save the entry.&#x20;
* You can add multiple ENV entries
* You can import ENVs from JSON
  * **Format:** JSON array of strings
  * **Example:** `["KEY=value", "FOO=bar", "PORT=3000"]`
* ⚠️ Environment variables are **publicly accessible** via the FluxCloud API if you have not enabled "Enterprise" in the General Tab.

### Commands (Optional)

Define CLI commands for your container in JSON array format\
**Example:** `["--logs", "--history", "version"]`

* Click the "Commands" button
* Enter the command, then click  the **"+ icon"** to save the entry.&#x20;
* You can add multiple run commands
* You can import Commands from JSON
  * **Format:** JSON array of strings
  * **Example:** `["npm install", "npm run build", "node server.js"]`
* &#x20;⚠️ Commands are **publicly accessible** via the FluxCloud API if you have not enabled "Enterprise" in the General Tab.

### Port Bindings

Set both the **Exposed Port** and the **Docker Container Port**

* Click the **"+ icon"** to save the entry
* You can add multiple port forwarding rules

#### Port Guidelines:

* **Exposed Port** must be between **1024–65535**
  * **Restricted ports** (do not use):\
    `['16100–16299', '26100–26299', '30000–30099', 22, 23, 25, 123, 161, 512, 513, 3388, 3889, 4444, 5800, 5900, 5901, 8384, 27017]`
* **Docker Container Port** should correspond to your app’s internal port (e.g., `80` for web servers)

### Custom Domains (Optional)

Once a **Port Forwarding** rule is added, you can assign a **custom domain**

* For setup instructions, refer to the [Custom Domain Setup](broken-reference) guide

### Hardware Resources

* Specify the **CPU, RAM, and storage** needed for this component.
