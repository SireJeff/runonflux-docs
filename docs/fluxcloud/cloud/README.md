# CLOUD

CLOUD is the **consumer-facing interface** for FluxCloud, designed for simplicity and ease of use. It offers a streamlined, step-by-step deployment experience that’s perfect for newcomers or non-technical users. It also supports key user-focused products such as **WordPress** and **FluxDrive**.

While it doesn't yet include all the advanced features of the HOME dashboard, CLOUD is regularly updated to reflect new platform capabilities.
