#### **Machine-Based Overclocking Profiles**

OC Profiles in FluxCore are machine-specific. Use the selection box at the top of the screen to choose the machine you want to create or manage OC profiles for.

#### **Types of OC Profiles**

There are two types of OC Profiles:

* Mining Profiles: These are linked to your Proof of Work (PoW) mining activities.
* PoUW Profiles: These apply when your machines are on lease for Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) activities.
