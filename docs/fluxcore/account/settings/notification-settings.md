**4. Machine Lease Stopped**

#### **Anti-Phishing Code Information**

On the top right of the user interface, you will see information regarding the status of your anti-phishing code. This code helps protect your account from phishing attacks by ensuring that all legitimate communications from FluxCore include a personalized code that only you know.

* **If Enabled**: You'll see a confirmation that your anti-phishing code is active.
* **If Not Enabled**: There’s an easy way to enable it directly from the UI.
