# Leases

The Audit Leases tab provides a comprehensive history of the machines you have leased to customers on FluxEdge.

You will see a detailed data table with information about all your lease activities.

* **Date**: The date and time when the lease started.
* **Machine**: The name of your machine that was leased.
* **Price/h**: The hourly rate during the lease period.
* **Duration**: The total time the machine was leased, measured in hours.
* **Penalty**: Indicates any penalties incurred due to forced stops, internet outages, or other disruptions that were not manually caused by the customer.
* **Total Rewards**: The total earnings from the lease, calculated as (price per hour \* duration) minus penalties and InFlux commission.

You also have tools to filter the data by specific durations (e.g., 1 week, 1 month, 1 year) and a CSV download tool for easy export.
