# All about the “Mining Dashboard” Module

FluxCore is carefully designed to give users total control over their machines. Anticipating a notable participation from the crypto-native community joining the PoUW network, we found it logical to seamlessly integrate a comprehensive mining software module into the FluxCore client.

Why is this Integration Important?

Crypto miners possess substantial GPU power, spanning across both older and newer models, all of which can be harnessed to address real-world challenges. However, recognizing the profit-oriented nature of individuals, we understand that users may prefer actively mining cryptocurrency over idling on the PoUW network without job requests.

To enhance user experience, we’ve integrated mining capabilities directly into FluxCore, eliminating the need for users to manually switch between FluxCore and other popular mining software like HiveOs, Bitdeer, Minerstat, and others.

This integration ensures a seamless experience, allowing users to connect their machines to the PoUW network via FluxCore while simultaneously engaging in cryptocurrency mining. Looking forward, we aim to develop an automated system enabling users to mine crypto during idle periods on the PoUW network and automatically switch to incoming jobs when more profitable.

**Enough for an Introduction. Let’s now delve into navigating and utilizing the Mining Module to guide you through your first initial miner configuration.**

1\. Ensure the Mining Module is installed; access to its Dashboard is only possible once the installation is complete. Click the Install Icon next to “Mining Module” on the menu bar to initiate the installation process. Once installed it will appear under AVAILABLE and you can access it

**My Machines**&#x20;

This is accomprehensive overview of all machines associated with your FluxCore account, encompassing both local and imported machines. This summary includes vital details like Machine Name, Uptime, and Block Reliability. Additionally, you can effortlessly track the revenue generated by the currently mined coins in both $ and asset values. Gain instant insights into your machine’s mining setup with key metrics such as Mining Software, Hash Rate, Fan Speed, Power Consumption, and GPU Status. This will help you navigate and optimize your mining experience with precision.

**Control**

This column enables you to effortlessly stop/start a miner, edit its configurations, or adjust overclocking settings.

**GPU Status**

<img src="https://help.runonflux.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-22.png" alt="" height="335" width="194"/>

Each box in the display corresponds to a single GPU. A grey box indicates that the GPU is currently unassigned for mining, while a green box signifies an active mining status. If a GPU’s temperature reaches 70 degrees Celsius or higher, the box turns yellow, serving as a caution for potential overheating. Once a GPU’s temperature reaches 80 degrees or higher, a red box alerts, signaling the need to inspect the setup, including fans, overclocking settings, etc. Additionally, a red stop icon signals that the GPU is either broken or wrongly configured.

Utilize these color-coded indicators to promptly identify and address issues with your GPUs, ensuring an optimal mining experience.

**Currently Earning**
