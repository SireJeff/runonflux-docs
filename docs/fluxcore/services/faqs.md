**Q: Why does it say "No OC Profile" even when I have set a default OC POUW profile?**

**A:** This message indicates that the profile is currently not in use because your machine is not performing any POUW operations at the moment.

**Q: How do I know if my default POUW profile is set?**

**A:** Follow these steps to confirm your default POUW profile:

1. Go to the service module and click on "My Machines."
2. Select the name of your machine.
3. Click on the "Overclocking" button at the top left of the page.

If your POUW profile is successfully set, it will appear with the name you chose, accompanied by a yellow star indicating "Default Config."
