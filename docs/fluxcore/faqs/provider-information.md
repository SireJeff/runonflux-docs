# Provider Information

1. **Will FluxCore switch from PoW to FluxEdge Lease when it is more profitable?** Currently, profitability is not a consideration. If you have enabled the Auto-Switch feature for your machine, it will be available for rent on FluxEdge, and the PoW mining configuration and applied OC profile (if applicable) will automatically stop during the lease.
2. **If my machine is on lease and the system goes down, reboots, has an internet outage, or any other issue, does the rental stop instantly?** If there are any reboots, internet outages, or similar issues, the machine rental will stop, affecting your reliability score. A 20% fee of your accrued rewards for that lease will be taken and given back to the customer as compensation for the disruption. Additionally, you have 5 minutes to be back online, or your machine will be removed from the cluster, requiring manual rejoining.
